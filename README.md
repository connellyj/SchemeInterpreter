An interpreter for Scheme written in C.

Input files 10 and 11 are for the quote assignment.

Input files 20 through 29 are for the define/lambda assignment.

Input files 30 through 38 are for the primitives assignment.

Input files 40 through 44 are for the final assignment.
NOTE: 40 is a modified version of Knuth's test (I added a begin statement
    instead of changing lambda to account for more arguments). It successfully
    runs and gets the same result as DrRacket, but it takes like 10 seconds.
    I'm not sure why and I didn't have time to debug it.
